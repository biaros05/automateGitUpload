# automateGitUpload
This script was created by me to automate git uploads on Windows OS!

## The script
This script was created to automate uploads to gitlab through the command line. In order to further automate your tasks, i recommend adding an alias to your ~/.bashrc file as follows (the following was done on a Windows OS):
```
vi ~/.bashrc
alias gitlab='bash [PATH]/uploadGit1'
```
Once you are ready for upload and want to use this alias, enter:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
Now, all you have to do is type **gitlab** in the command line in order to begin your upload!
